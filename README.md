Development of CCD for GPy

[Alan Saul](https://github.com/alansaul) wrote most of the CCD code for GPy. This repo is just to finish off testing and getting a few bits working, etc.

Note: This repo is testing the [ccd branch](https://github.com/SheffieldML/GPy/tree/ccd) of GPy, which might one day be merged with GPy.
